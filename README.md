# AI Learning Journey

This repository contains various implementations of AI techniques I've explored while learning about artificial intelligence. Rather than a production-ready framework, this is a personal collection of code, experiments, and notebooks that showcase different approaches to AI problems.

## Contents

- **Genetic Algorithms**: Implementations for solving optimization problems like Knapsack and TSP
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive demonstrations of algorithms in action
- **Experiments**: Various attempts at solving different problems

## Getting Started

Use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to run the code in this repository. It's a simple tool that allows you to run Python code without setting up a virtual environment.

```sh
uv sync  # Install dependencies & sync the environment
```
## Structure

The project maintains a simple organization:

- [`doc/`](doc/) - Jupyter notebooks and documentation
- [`src/`](src/) - Source code for implementations
- [`data/`](data/) - Data files and outputs

## License

This project is for educational purposes. That's why it uses the [MIT License](LICENSE) to allow you to use the code freely.
