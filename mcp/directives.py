AI Directives MCP (ai_directives)

This server provides a suite of master prompts designed to act as a persistent
system context or behavioral framework for an AI assistant.

Its purpose is to configure the AI's personality, coding style, and strategic
approach at the beginning of a work session, ensuring consistent and high-quality
collaboration.
